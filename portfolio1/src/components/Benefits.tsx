            Problem? what is that? I only focus on solution or finding them. As
            a software engineer there is either problems that have been solved
            or problems yet to solve. no inbetween. So I seek solutions, whether
            that`s from my network, books, online resources, or tech communities
            on Discord - I am part of several - but most importantly, I have a
            mentor in my ring corner who has been doing this for 25+ years - so
            the wealth of knowledge at my disposal is not quantifiable.

            EFFECTIVE COLLABORATOR AND COMMUNICATOR
          </h3>
          <p className="text-black text-center">
            The value of collaboration and communication cannot be understated.
            I value it so much that I lead a group of CS degree holding devs and
            some self taught engineers in bi weekly hackathons to produce MVP
            for creative ideas that are voted on by the Hack Weekly community.
